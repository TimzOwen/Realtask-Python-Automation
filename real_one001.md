 ## Python external tools

    #### built-in Libraries and external libraries

    New libraries are published in (PYPL): python package index

    [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/)

    #### Python image library

    used to convert images and manipulate images

    [PIL library for python below version 3](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/)

    [Pillow image lib for python 3](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/)

    Ubuntu install:

        sudo apt install python3-pil

        pip3 install pillow ---> for other packages

    #### API (Application Programming Interface)

    Helps different pieces of software to talk to each other

    Have a deeper understanding of how functions are called and used in APIs

    Can also be used as pieces of software 

    used as a communicaiton platform for softwares

    [Saving breaking changes in an API](https://semver.org/#summary)

    #### Making Sense out of  an API

    Have your APIs functions follow naming conventions to help a user have a clear expectation

    Example:

        from PIL import Image
        im = Image.open("bride.jpg")
        im.rotate(45).show()

    [Reference page for the image objects above ](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/Image.html)

    For py library like PIL its documented using docstring (Doc that lives within the code)
